Hello! My name is Rebecca, and I am a first-year Computer Science Master's student at UCLA as a DeepMind Fellow. I'm currently doing research in NLP, specifically on low-resource languages and code-switching datasets with Prof. Peng's [Plus Lab](https://vnpeng.net/), as well as [Prof. Caccoulos](https://sip.la.psu.edu/people/rct11/) at Penn State. I received my B.S. with Honors at Stanford University, where I wrote my thesis under the advisement of Prof. Christopher Manning.

More broadly, I am interested in ethically preserving languages and the cultural relevance they hold for historically marginalized communities. When I am not working, you can find me writing, dancing flamenco, and collecting earrings!

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
