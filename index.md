Hello! My name is Rebecca, and I am a second-year Computer Science Master's student at UCLA as a DeepMind Fellow. I'm currently doing research in NLP, specifically on low-resource languages and code-switching datasets with Prof. Peng's [Plus Lab](https://vnpeng.net/), as well as [Prof. Cacoullos](https://sip.la.psu.edu/people/rct11/) at Penn State. I received my B.S. with Honors at Stanford University, where I wrote my thesis under the advisement of Prof. Christopher Manning.

More broadly, I am interested in ethically preserving languages and the cultural relevance they hold for historically marginalized communities. When I am not working, you can find me writing, dancing flamenco, and collecting earrings!

# Hobbies

While at Stanford, I danced with [Aleta Hayes'](https://www.aletahayes.com/about) Chocolate Heads company! Check out our performances below:

* ["Fashion Fable"](https://vimeo.com/742072113), 2022, Stanford's Cantor Museum
* ["Riot of Spring"](https://vimeo.com/579947905), 2021, Zoom
* ["Traveling in Place"](https://vimeo.com/580049177), 2020, Zoom

Before that, I danced flamenco at the National Institute of Flamenco for thirteen years. During my senior year of high school, I performed with the University of New Mexico's dance company in ["Elementos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAg5wkbgqok) choreographed by Adrian Santana.
