Hello! My name is Rebecca, and I am a first-year Computer Science Master's student at UCLA as a DeepMind Fellow. I'm currently doing research in NLP, specifically on low-resource languages and code-switching datasets with Prof. Peng's [Plus Lab](https://vnpeng.net/), as well as [Prof. Caccoulos](https://sip.la.psu.edu/people/rct11/) at Penn State. I received my B.S. with Honors at Stanford University, where I wrote my thesis under the advisement of Prof. Christopher Manning.

More broadly, I am interested in ethically preserving languages and the cultural relevance they hold for historically marginalized communities. When I am not working, you can find me writing, dancing flamenco, and collecting earrings!

  <br>
  Translanguaging, or the act of using multiple languages within a speech utterance (e.g., sentence and/or word), is a global phenomenon for multilingual communities. In the context of the United States, translanguaging is a frequent occurrence among Latin American immigrant communities. While there are several large multilingual models such as XLM-RoBERTa and multilingual BERT, these models have been trained on and evaluated with parallel monolingual data. Upholding parallel monolingualism as the standard definition of multilingualism erases the language practices of many communities of color, including Latin American immigrants in the United States. The consequences are even worse for racialized children in the schooling system who may be labeled as English Language Learners (ELL) for the very notion that their fluency in multiple languages must be separate and apart. This ELL label has immediate consequences regarding future classes they have access to, as well as their own sentiment around and through their language practices. Moreover, there is currently no labeled NLP dataset that includes translanguaging between Spanish and English for the task of sentiment analysis. In collaboration with the Stanford Graduate School of Education, this research aims to center the voices of first-generation Indigenous Latin American immigrant students in NLP research through the task of sentiment analysis. Specifically, this thesis constructs the Interview Transcripts Dataset, an innovate trilingual dataset composed of transcribed interview data that contain instances of translanguaging, as well as a framework for developing these datasets. The findings of this project provide a promising starting point, and emphasize the need to leverage current pre-trained models on similar domains as well as develop a more robust large-scale dataset that centers translanguaging. Ultimately, translanguaging remains an open problem in NLP research tasks.

  In US K-12 education, the Spanish language is subject to practices and policies that limit its expression, especially among Latinx students. However, Spanish is seen as a positive form of diversity in higher education. In light of these contradictions, we examine the degree to which Spanish is strategically deployed in selective college admissions by high school students in their admissions essays. We use two years of undergraduate application essays (n = 276,768) and metadata submitted to the University of California by every self-identified Latinx applicant and a racially representative random sample of non-Latinx applicants. Our paper unfolds by first identifying instances of Spanish usage in the essays, followed by analyses of how Spanish is being used and by whom. To identify Spanish language usage in the text, we develop a computational mixed methods approach by combining machine translation and human reading and checking of the text. Spanish was used by 33% of Latinx and 15% of non-Latinx students with stylistic variation by class and ethnicity. This strategy, which we call strategic Spanish, is notable in the breadth of users including Spanish in their admissions essays. Beyond this general trend, we find that below median income Mexican and Central American applicants were the most likely to use substantive forms of Spanish in their admissions essays as well as provide translations into English. We posit this as an example of students identifying cultural mismatch between themselves and university admissions offices due to the perceived need of translating the Spanish words and phrases.
