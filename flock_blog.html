  <h2>Diving Into Flock's Network: <br>Police Departments across the nation can see where we've been</h2>

  <p>
    On their website, Flock touts the ability for its automatic license plate reader (LPR) technology to stop 
    crimes throughout the nation. In their emphasis of their nationwide reach, they note the ability for customers, 
    including law enforcement, to locate suspects across state borders through cross-customer data sharing. Indeed, 
    documents obtained by the ACLU of Massachusetts indicate that police departments across the nation have extensive access 
    to an individual's driving history, and that police departments in Massachusetts are sharing our data nationwide. This bears 
    serious legal implications, such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/victory-grand-jury-finds-sacramento-cops-illegally-shared-driver-data-putting"
    >prosecutors in states where abortion is illegal being able to track an individual's location external to their state in the 
    event they seek an abortion</a>. The increasing implementation 
    of Flock cameras and automatic LPRs documenting our every move combined with their broad data sharing agreements pose potentially
    major civil rights violations.
  </p>

  <p>
    In just one month's span (June - July 2025), records from Attleboro's Police Department show that at least 44,000 search requests 
    were made to their LPR database. Each request is accompanied with the name of the organization making the request, such as "Sugar Land 
    TX PD." Each request also indicates the breadth of that organization's Flock network, or how many other customers they are 
    sharing their data to, and in turn, receiving data from (see <a href="https://data.aclum.org/2025/10/07/flock-gives-law-enforcement-all-over-the-country-access-to-your-location/">previous post</a>
    explaining Flock's "show me yours and I'll show you mine"
    style of data sharing agreements). Our team's analysis reveals that on average, most states' police departments opting into Flock's 
    database are able to search through upwards of 80,000 devices (e.g., cameras) at a time. Massachusetts' network lies on the smaller end of that,
    with an average of around 15,000 devices. Given that these police department's searches appear in audits obtained from 
    local Massachusetts police departments, it is safe to assume that our local police departments are sharing our data to all 
    the states colored below. In other words, police departments in the colored states have access to individual's movements through 
    Massachusetts without needing to provide any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.

  <p>
    Flock's automatic LPR system also uses AI to create a completely automatic profile of each car that passes the camera, allowing 
    for any customer in the network to conduct granular searches through the "Filters" category. The filters possible therefore include 
    color and stickers or marks present on the vehicle, as well as filtering the images by geolocation (i.e., within a state border). 
    Importantly, if no filter is placed, law enforcement is essentially searching through their entire database, more often than not spanning 
    over 80,000 devices with images of vehicles across the nation. Indeed, poking into the data, our findings reveal that over 50% of the searches 
    conducted by police departments were conducted with no filter at all. Below is a state-by-state breakdown of each state's police departments 
    patterns in searching without filters.
  </p>

  <p>Rather than enforcing specificity in searches alongside sturdy legal reasoning for their search, Flock allows law enforcement and other 
    customers to enter vague reasons without filtering. This unvetted and all-encompassing access to an individual's driving movement across 
    the nation poses major threats to their civil rights, especially related to their right to healthcare access. In relation to 
    Massachusetts, this technology could potentially be in violation of the state's updated Shield Law, which is meant to protect people 
    entering Massachusetts to receive healthcare that is lawful in the state without out-of-state surveillance.
  </p>

  <p>
    We demand that local police departments <u>stop sharing driver's data</u> across the nation. As the scope of Flock cameras and automatic
    license plate readers increase, we emphasize that this technology must to be regulated to ensure we are protecting the civil rights of 
    individuals residing in Massachusetts.
